### Question: Which of the 3 US Major Cities (NYC, LA, Chicago) has the best hotels?
### Problem: In the 21st century, due to the vast amounts of media, most vacationers often choose their destination from pure critic ratings and other unorganized statistics, but few recognize more than one or two reviews/comments, leading to a chance of biased descision-making when choosing a city to travel to. 

### Solution: Delve deeper into the sentimentality of human reviews using the NaiveBayes Analyzer and developing a review word cloud to help understand the true nature of reviews, and how certain types of businesses receive reviews with key words that convey telling information on quality.
